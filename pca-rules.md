_Note: In order to keep competition fair and balanced, all rules are subject to change as EA releases patches for the game. As we know, EA usually fixes 2 bugs and adds 3, and it is important for us to have the liberty to change rules as new exploits and bugs get added to the game._

_Note: If you have any questions about the following ruleset, do not hesitate to reach out to a LO for clarification._

_Note: Participation in friendlies vs PCA teams counts as participation in PCA, and we reserve the right to punish the use of 3rd party software for cheating in friendlies._

_Note: The league staff may refer to EST or EDT when talking about Eastern Time (whichever applicable to the time of the comment/post)._

_Note: If a PCA member is able to prove that precedent set in the past is not in the rules or seen to be an incorrect interpretation of the rules written, then the past precedent may be disregarded for current or future circumstances._



## 1. Community Code of Conduct
* All players are expected to exhibit good sportsmanship and maintain respect for one another, this includes players, staff, and league officials. They are to treat others as they themselves would like to be treated. Any behavior that is considered to be inappropriate and in violation of the code of conduct includes, but is not limited to, the following:
  * Non-fair-play behavior, physical or verbal abuse towards players, staff, or any participant.
  * Acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner, or with the intent to disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the league
  * Abuse, threaten or harass any other person.
  * Engaging in collusion, which is an agreement between two or more clubs or players on different clubs to predetermine the outcome of a game.
  * Engaging in violence or any activity which is deemed in the judgment of the LOs to be immoral, unethical, disgraceful, or contrary to common standards of decency.
* Any player who violates these rules may be disqualified or sanctioned via the points system. Warnings and sanctions may lead to immediate disqualification and removal of the player and his club from the league. These decisions will be at the discretion of LOs. If you think a rule has been broken, create a ticket to talk to LOs.
* If an interaction that violates the above code of conduct between two members happens outside of the PCA Discord and is reported to the LOs, punishments can be given depending on the severity of the breach.

## 2. Rule Breaks
* League Officials are responsible for league related issues that take place immediately before, during, and after matches.
  * If  you think a rule has been broken, submit a ticket in the PCA Discord to get in direct contact with the LOs. If you DM an LO with a league related issue, you will be asked to make a ticket. The purpose of this is so that all LOs can have all information involving the issue being reported, which will help make the process faster.
* If a rule has been broken during a match, continue to play the match and then submit a ticket after the match is over.
* Punishments for rule breaks are in the Disciplinary System section.

## 3. Rosters and Players
* Minimum Roster Size is 10.
* Maximum Roster Size is 16.
* Players must be in the PCA Discord in order to be on a roster and eligible to play.
* Players must be listed on the clubs roster channel in order to be officially on a roster and eligible to play. Any changes to the roster must be posted in the #roster-changes so players can get their roles. Origins must be posted along with tagging their discord in #roster-changes. The purpose of this is to help LOs give roles faster and be able to enter them into the league spreadsheet system accurately.
  * Managers are responsible for keeping their roster in discord updated as they make signings and transfers throughout the season, failure to do so can result in the player being deemed ineligible, and is sanctionable via the point system. Players will be added to the league spreadsheet system after the next matchday following their signing.
* Designated Player System
  * This system is designed to keep the core of your squad committed till the end of the season, offering protection to both the player and the manager.
  * Designated Players can be set only after the pre-season cup.
  * If you make a player a designated player, it is permanent for the remainder of the season.
  * Designated Players cannot be released during the season under ANY circumstance.
  * Both player and manager MUST agree to a player becoming a designated player.
  * Managers must message an LO with screenshot proof that a player has accepted DP status in order for it to be given the DP status.
  * Managers must post designated player appointments in #roster-changes and players will be given the DP role and status.
  * Maximum of 6 designated players per club.
  * Designated player status only lasts one season. Teams continuing for more than one season will have to re-sign designated players after the pre-season cup of the next season.
* Every player must read, understand, and agree to the rules for participation in the league. Players consent to the rules and the LO’s ability to enforce them as a condition of their participation in the PCA league.
  * Each player is expected and required to abide by the rules, and failure to do so will result in sanctions. See “Rule Enforcement” for more information.
* Players can leave their clubs at any time, and can contact an LO if their manager refuses to release them. LOs can then manually release a player from their club.
  * Players that are released in this way will be made restricted agents if they have played for the club they are released from, or free agents if they have not played for the club they are released from.

## 4. Managers
* Each club must have a designated manager.
* The manager must be on the roster for the team they are managing.
* The manager is responsible for communication with other captains and League Officials, especially before, during, and after matches.
* The manager has to be reachable on Discord, and must respond to requests from League Officials in a timely manner (48 hours). Managers (and their clubs) who repeatedly disregard messages from League Officials are subject to potential sanctions via the point system.
* The manager should frequently check the League’s Discord announcement AND manager channel to be aware of any announcement made by League Officials.
  * The announcement channel can be followed in your teams discord, which can be a very helpful feature to not miss any important information distributed by the league.
* The manager will be the spokesperson of the club in case of a dispute.

## 5. Transfers
* Players may play for a maximum of 2 clubs in a season.
  * If your club withdraws from the competition, that counts as a club played for.
  * This only applies to the current season.
  * Designated Players can not be signed at any point during the season.
  * Playing for a team in the pre-season cup does not count as a team played for in the season.
* The transfer window will be open once for one week during the mid-point in the season (exact dates to be announced by the LO club later). The length and start dates will change from season to season.
* Players are allowed to transfer from one club to another during the transfer window provided they have only played for one club that season.
* Free agents are allowed to be signed at any point during the regular season. See “Champions Cup Rules” for the special transfer rules during the Champions Cup.
* A transfer is locked in after a player has made their debut for the club. A player that is signed and then released without playing a game for a team will be a free agent, not a restricted agent.
* Roster changes must be made 2 hours prior (7:00 PM EST) to matches in order for the player who is being signed to be eligible to play that night.

Please see the “Withdrawal From Competition” Section for an alternate set of rules affecting players of folded clubs.

## 6. Loans
* Managers can submit a loan list of up to 5 names to #loan-list, which can only be updated every Wednesday before 8pm EST via editing your previous message (to reduce spam in the channel).
  * Players on the loan list are still eligible to play for their parent club if they are not being loaned out.
* In order for a player to be loaned, clubs must contact the manager first for permission. Once they have obtained permission, they can then contact the player.
* Players have the right to refuse a loan.
* Designated players and Managers/Captains cannot be loaned.
* Loan will last one matchday only.
* No loans are allowed during both cup competitions.
* A club can loan in a maximum of 2 players for a matchday.
* A maximum of 1 player can be loaned in from the same club.
* A player can only be loaned to the same team 2 times in a row. This is to prevent circumventing the transfer system.
* A loan player may not play against their parent club (the club they came from).
* Managers must announce player loans in #roster-changes in order for the loan to be valid.
* Stats CAN be gathered for loan players, but is not required. The parent club can either obtain the stat videos from the team the player played on, or the player can gather their own stats and give to their manager to input into the stat sheet.

_Note: Free Agents do not count as loans. All loan players must come from an existing PCA club._



## 7. League Format
* The season starts at the beginning of the regular season and ends at the end of the champions cup.
  * The pre-season cup is not a part of the season. It is required for teams to participate in the pre-season cup to play during the season.
  * Teams that play in the pre-season cup are not guaranteed to be accepted into the regular season.
  * The LOs can add teams after the pre-season cup if they deem necessary. This is to prevent starting the season with a bot team, as each regular season needs to be started with an even amount of teams.
* Matches will be played on Sunday at 9:00 and 9:30pm EST, and on Wednesday at 9:30pm and 10:00pm EST.
* In the event of clubs tied on the table at the end of the season, head to head goal difference will serve as the tie breaker. This is unable to be showed on the league spreadsheet. For an accurate account of standings, if head to head goal difference is serving as a tiebreaker, a note will be provided when the table is posted in the PCA discord.
  * If the club you are tied with on points has a better goal difference against you after the season has ended, this will break the tie.
* Second tie breaker is the club with more wins.
* Third tie breaker is the club with fewer losses.
* Fourth tie breaker is a playoff round between the two clubs, winner gets the higher position on the table.
  * If there are more than two clubs tied for the same league table position, the seeding will be determined by the disciplinary system. The lowest tally of points gained from breaking rules will win this tiebreaker.

## 8. Stadium Rules
* Stadiums can be banned based on how they affect camera angles, especially the GK camera.
* List of banned stadiums (will be added to as issues come up):
  * Estadio de vallecas
  * Vitality Stadium
  * Stade Municipal
  * Stadion an der Alten Försterei
  * Estadio de Vallecas
  * Carrow Road
  * Otkritie Arena
  * Deutshe Bank Park
  * Brentford Community Stadium
  * Red Bull Arena
* If a team asks you to change your stadium, you must change your stadium and report the name of the stadium to an LO so it can be added to the above list.
  * The only reason you can ask a team to change a stadium is if it messes up pro camera, gk camera, or other camera angles.
  * If this occurs, please send a video to the LOs with information about the stadium and camera that it glitches, and we will add to the banned stadium list.
* Stadium customization
  * Only white pitch lines, all other colors are strictly prohibited

## 9. Pre-Match Rules
* Custom jerseys are acceptable as long as the club has a light and a dark colored jersey.
  * This is especially important with the kit bug that defaults your opponents to a white colored kit.
* Lineups must be submitted before kickoff (9:00pm EST on Sundays, 9:30pm on Wednesdays). This can be a screenshot of the lobby, or a picture from a site such as [Football Formation Creator - Make Your Team and Share Tactics (buildlineup.com)](https://www.buildlineup.com/).
  * If your game is being broadcasted, lineups are due AN HOUR BEFORE kickoff. This is to help casters prepare for matches.
    * If you are unsure who is available, make an accurate lineup based on your information at that time, and make substitutions leading up to kickoff.
  * If you need to make a substitution for your lineup, please send a message in your stats channel detailing the change in the lineup and submit a new lineup if possible.
* Matches are played as “Club Friendlies” in the Pro Clubs match lobby.
* Matches are REQUIRED to be streamed on either Twitch or Youtube. Please see the “Streamer Settings” section for settings and rules.
  * If a game is unable to be streamed, the game must be recorded. Failure to record your game is a sanctionable offense via the point system if the game has not been streamed.
* Clubs must field 8 human controlled players.
  * Games can be started with fewer players with the other manager’s consent, however the club playing with less than 8 will be sanctioned via the point system.
* The “Any” role is required. Bots can do things that players cannot, and this rule prevents this advantage.
* Matches must be started within 10 minutes of the scheduled time.
  * If a club is intentionally waiting past the allotted 10 minutes, please create a ticket so the LOs can review the situation. This behavior can lead to sanctions. Stream or conversation evidence must be submitted to the LOs using the ticket system.
* If a club needs to reschedule a match, they are encouraged to contact the clubs they are facing days in advance, so that a new date and time can be selected. It is important to note that clubs are not obligated to accept a rematch if it is not feasible.
  * Should a reschedule be requested, clubs will have one week to schedule the match.
    * If a time cannot be agreed upon, LOs will get involved and set a time for the match that must be adhered to.
  * If a reschedule is agreed to, it must be posted to the #reschedule-chat, and both managers must react to the post with a checkmark or thumbs up, or the reschedule will not be valid.
* Each club is responsible for knowing their schedule and are expected to be prepared for games. If a club does not have the full 8 required to play and does not get permission from the other club to play without a full amount, then the game is deemed a forfeit.
* Every player is required to be in the PCA Discord team voice chat during official games (cup, league, etc.). This rule helps prevent ineligible players from taking part in a competitive match.
  * Even if a player doesn’t have a microphone, has excessive background noise, etc., they are still required to be in the voice chat either muted or deafened if needed.
* Each club is required to have PCA as a part of their in game club name.
* Matches will be hosted by the club listed as “Home” on the schedule.
  * If a club does not have someone able to send from the NA East servers (Columbus, Miami, Arlington, and Dallas) then they will not be eligible to be the home club due to ping issues, and will be formally notified by LOs if they are no longer allowed to host.

## 10. Match Rules
* Game results:
  * Games that are won count as 3 points
  * Games that are tied count as 1 point
  * Games that are lost count as 0 points
* After the game, you must submit results via screenshot no later than 10:30pm EST
* If a match is interrupted for issues such as server crash, network outage, or power outage managers may decide to reschedule the match or replace the player with a sub.
* If a server crash, network outage, natural disaster, power outage, or personal emergency occurs that lowers the amount of players you can field below 8, managers can decide to reschedule the match.
  * For more information on reschedules, see the “Pre-Match Rules” section.
* If a player disconnects within 15 minutes of the start the game may be restarted. If any goals are scored before a team is finished alt-tabbing the game, they are counted in the overall result after the game. This is to discourage teams tabbing if an early goal is scored and wiping it off the scoreboard. If any red cards occur, the player who received the red card must get another red card as fast as possible after the match has restarted.
  * This can be done easily if both teams cooperate. Whichever team did not receive the red card should be given possession of the ball. When this is done, whoever has the ball should stand still. The player who received the red card should run and slide the person on the ball as fast as they can. Repeat if a red card is not given. This should not take more than 5-10 in game minutes.
  * If players do not cooperate with this process, they are subject to be punished with timewasting.
* If the “Any” disconnects within 15 minutes of the start the game may be restarted. If any goals are scored before a team is finished alt-tabbing the game, they are counted in the overall result after the game. If any red cards occur, the player who received the red card must get another red card as fast as possible after the match has restarted. Instructions for this are listed above.
* Repeated disconnects by the “Any” (intentional or not) will lead to that player being banned from playing the “Any” role in the future.
* If a team disconnects after the 15 minute mark, the game is a forfeit win for the other team.
* Time wasting is strictly prohibited.
  * Time wasting is defined as L2/LT shielding (jockey function) in or near the corner at any point in the game. Failing to comply with the red card replication process is also considered time wasting.
    * If time wasting has occurred, please submit a ticket in the PCA Discord with a clip of the incident.
    * LOs will vote to determine if time wasting has occurred, and then the severity of the time wasting.
      * Mild timewasting will be punished with a goal given to the other club and a one game ban for the player who broke the rule.
      * Moderate time wasting will be punished with a one point deduction, goal given to the other club, and a two game ban for the player who broke the rule.
      * Severe timewasting will be punished with a match forfeit.
* Tabbing a GK on purpose to gain the use of a bot GK is not allowed under any circumstances.
* Pausing to deliberately take advantage of an AI controller player when the any has disconnected is strictly prohibited.
* There are several disallowed actions on Set Pieces:
  * Blocking the goalkeeper on set pieces is not allowed.
    * Any goals scored while the keeper is being blocked will not count.
    * If the GK runs forward into another player after the ball has been kicked, this is not blocking the keeper. It is important to note that the GK must initiate contact. If a player initiates the contact after the ball is kicked, this still counts as blocking the GK.
  * Standing on the goal line on free kicks is not allowed.
    * If this rule is broken, a goal is added for the club with a free kick.
  * Using the glitch that moves the ball for a free kick is strictly prohibited.
  * Jumping out of the wall while defending a free kick is strictly prohibited.
  * Only 2 players are allowed to stand on the line for corners.
  * On goal kicks, players on the kicking team are not permitted to stand behind in the area in line with or behind the 18 yard box in the opposition’s half in order to receive the goal kick.
* Hacking, exploiting, the use of any kind of cheating device and/or cheat programs, or any similar cheating method is prohibited, even in the “friendly”  matches with another PCA team (this does not include division matches).
* Intentionally using any in-game bugs or so-called “hacks” to seek an advantage is prohibited.
* Cheating, manipulating game files, using unapproved game modifications, or any other method by which one may or may not gain an unfair advantage over another player.

## 11. Stat Collection
* Stats must be collected at the end of each match for all players on your team.
  * If you can, please gather the stats for the other team, however this is not required.
* All statistics tabs for every player must be recorded.
  * The stat tabs are as follows: summary, possession, shooting, passing, defending, and goalkeeping.
* If there is a draw, make sure that your team does not leave the game until both you and the opponent have collected all stats.
  * In order to do this, the team who kicks off holds possession by standing still with the ball until they are done collecting stats (the other team MUST NOT try to win the ball back. This adds stats to players which boosts their performance for TOTW. Players that do this will have their stats wiped for the game they do this.). When your stats are done being collected, kick the ball out of bounds for a throw in. When the other team is done collecting stats, they will kick it out for a throw in.
  * Once BOTH TEAMS have kicked the ball out for a throw in, then you can safely tab out of the match.

## 12. Disciplinary System
* Disciplinary points gained during a season can carry over to the next one. Either half the points accrued during the season or 10 points will be subtracted from season to season, whichever number is higher.
  * Disciplinary points follow the manager, not the club. For example, if a manager folds one team and makes another, their disciplinary points will follow them.

## 17. Club Applications

For new clubs (and old clubs to be eligible to play next season) wishing to enter the league, please make a post in #club-applications. Please answer all questions with thought, and an LO will respond to you in #proposal-review.

  * It is recommended that you have at least the minimum roster requirements when making a club application
* If a club agrees to take part in the league, they agree to play in all competitions in the league unless they fold or withdraw from a competition.
  * Teams that withdraw from competition will be punished in accordance with the rules below

## 18. Withdrawal From Competition

Clubs that withdraw from the league have a special set of rules that apply to both the manager of that club and players from that club. Withdrawal from competition includes both the regular league season and the postseason champions cup.

Managers:


* A manager that withdraws their club from competition will lose the right to play for the remainder of the season
  * If a manager finds a replacement manager, then they can look for a new club. This will count against the two clubs per season maximum. A manager that does this is ineligible to play for 1/4th of the season.
* Managers that withdraw a club from the competition will be banned from being a manager or a captain for the rest of the season and the season after, or a length determined by LOs.

Players:


* Players from a withdrawn club become a restricted agent 2. This means they can only join a new club after a time window of 1/4th the season length (LOs will provide the date players become eligible again)

## 19. Manager Checklist

Before Games:


* Submit accurate lineups before the game in your clubs
  * If your game is being broadcasted, your lineup must be submitted 1 hour before
* If your lineup has to change after you post it (for example a player suddenly can’t make it), be sure to submit a new one before the game starts or note the change below the original post.
* Make sure someone on your club is streaming the game and collecting stats.

After Games:


* Submit a screenshot of the result of your games into your club’s stat chat right after both games are done
* Record stats for your matches before the next matchday

## 20. Voting System

League Officials follow a strict voting system, as detailed below:


* Step 1: An idea is brought forward either by the community in the suggestions channel or internally that will get voted on
* Step 2: LOs will vote on a decision. Results of these votes will be made public if a decision is reached
* Step 3: If the LO vote is equal to or less than a ratio of 4/7, then the vote will go to LAs. Results of these votes will be made public if a decision is reached
* Step 4: If the LA decision is still less than or equal to a ratio of 4/7, then LOs will discuss what should happen next, whether it goes to managers or a public poll. If we can’t agree efficiently a vote will occur to determine the next step. Results of these votes will be made public.
* Step 5: If it goes to managers, they will vote for a decision that LOs will then discuss and make a final decision on
* Step 6: If the LOs decide to make the poll public, a poll will be created in #open-polls to gauge public opinion. If 75% of the people vote one way or the other then the decision is final.

In this system, the public gets to review some decisions made and if the large majority decides one way or the other, LOs will take that into major consideration when discussing a final decision.

If you wish to discuss any vote or poll, you have two options to do this:



* Option 1: Discuss the vote and its implications in #vote-discussion. Keep in mind discussions should be held cordially and with respect for differing opinions.
* Option 2: Open a ticket. This will create a direct line of communication with LOs where opinions can be shared respectfully and one on one discussion can be had. Abuse of this system will result in the ability to create tickets being removed.
